scoreboard (finish after xx points ) 


setting up the board for both players at the beginning


- turn 3: make sure only the second settlement can build roads for player 1




#maybe:

if 7 rolled robber is activated




on 7: takes cards away even if hand < 7 - fixed?


remove dice roll after the end of the turn


cities only give you one resource instead of two - fixed


hub: wood - merchant: lumber - fixed


Player 2: only add 1 point when building city              ???? thats correct


player 2: doesnt let me buy dev card with 2 wheat, 1 rock, 1 sheep - fixed


player 2: monopoly: says i dont own a card even though i got 1 - fixed


pop up message for longest road, largest army - not done!


'10' instead '10 points' - dont remember what it was?
